# Note-Taking Application

## Overview

This Note-Taking Application is designed to help small business owners organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks efficiently. Users can write and save notes, providing a convenient way to manage information.

### User Stories

- As a small business owner, I want to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

### Application Features

- When I open the Note Taker, I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
- When I click on the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
- When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
- When I click on the Save button, the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes, and the buttons in the navigation disappear.
- When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column, and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.
- When I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column, and the button disappears.
